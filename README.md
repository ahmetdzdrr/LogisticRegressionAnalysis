# LogisticRegressionAnalysis
We analyzed the "Automobile Loan" dataset by performing data preprocessing, data visualization, and analysis using various models.

DATA PREPROCESSING

In this section, we performed various steps such as removing, filling, and adding variables on both numerical and categorical columns by thoroughly examining all the information in the data. The steps we performed started with numerical data and concluded with categorical data.

DATA VISUALIZATION

In this section, we created a visualization to analyze the distribution of our dependent variable, aiming to perform analysis on it.

We observed other variables through visualization to check if they have an impact on the data.
